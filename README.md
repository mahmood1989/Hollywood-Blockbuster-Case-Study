# Hollywood-Blockbuster-Case-Study
Develop a machine learning model that uses attributes such as genre, source, use of computer graphics, the star power of the cast etc. to predict  degree of success of Hollywood movies (Quantiphi Project).

The Hollywood movie production business has a very instinct and contact driven low-tech decision-making process that generates a portfolio of movies that a production house decides to fund in any given year. The same type of decision-making process is employed by movie stars and their agents to decide which projects to pursue and which ones to pass. This leads to a high degree of variation in the success rate of projects (as measured by gross box office receipts and return in investment). Most production houses employ a portfolio driven approach and diversify their risk across a number of low, medium and high budget movies.

There is a variety of academic research that suggests that attributes like genre, source, use of computer graphics, the star power of the cast etc have some degree of predictive power in classifying the degree of success of a project. Further, the emergence of social media has made it possible to track the collective sentiment around a movie project long before committing a sizable amount of capital on production, distribution and marketing.

As part of Quantiphi labs, we have collected data on Hollywood movies from a variety of public and commercial sources. The next phase of the project is to develop a predictive model that will enable us to outperform the classification accuracy achieved in previous academic models. 

The data sources used are public (such as IMDB) and commercial (box office receipts). A limited version of the training and scoring data set is attached along with the data definition file.
